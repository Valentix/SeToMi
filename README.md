# SeToMi
SeToMi as abbreviation of Serial To Midi.
This project aims to create a program that fetches serial (already formatted as midi for now) inputs from usb connected devices (such as arduino) and create a midi channel to communicate events with daws (like LMMS).

SeToMi is fully opensource and will be available soon(tm) for Linux and Windows (no mac development until i can afford one)
I would like to create an up to date and all in one package alternative to Hairless Midi and loopMidi combo that works but not as I want.
Also maybe I will learn something building this project so...
I'm not actually a programmer I use to program in my free time so updates won't be really frequent.
